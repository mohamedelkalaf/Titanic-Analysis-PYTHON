# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction (Classification Analysis)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the famous **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival using **classification models**.  
The goal is to understand which factors (age, gender, class, etc.) were most influential in determining survival.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset contains passenger information with the following key variables:

| Variable     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Pclass       | Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).                                      |
| Survived     | Survival status (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).                        |
| Name         | Passengerâ€™s full name.                                                      |
| Sex          | Gender of the passenger (male/female).                                      |
| Age          | Passengerâ€™s age (may include missing values).                               |
| SibSp        | Number of siblings/spouses aboard.                                          |
| Parch        | Number of parents/children aboard.                                          |
| Ticket       | Ticket number.                                                              |
| Fare         | Fare paid for the ticket (may include missing values).                      |
| Cabin        | Cabin number (many values missing).                                         |
| Embarked     | Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).       |
| Boat         | Lifeboat number (if rescued).                                               |
| Body         | Identification number of recovered body (if applicable).                    |
| Home.Dest    | Passengerâ€™s home destination.                                               |

## ðŸ”Ž Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ demographics, class distributions, survival rates  
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ encoding categorical features, handling missing values  
4. **Classification Modeling** â€“ Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.  
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Classification Report & Accuracy

## ðŸš€ Results
- **Accuracy:** ~78.9%  
- The model performs well in identifying passengers who did **not survive** (high recall = 89%).  
- Predicting survivors is more challenging (recall = 64%).  
- **Key influential features:** Passenger Class, Gender, Age, Fare.
